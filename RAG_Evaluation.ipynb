This indicates that the company's ability to generate returns on its equity has decreased.\\n2. **EPS (Earnings Per Share) Trend**: The EPS has also been declining, from 16.92 in 2019 to 13.58 in 2023. This suggests that the company's earnings per share have decreased over time.\\n3. **Profit Margin**: The profit margin has been relatively stable, ranging from 22.45% in 2020 to 26.70% in 2022. However, it declined to 22.19% in 2023.\\n4. **Cash Flow**: The cash flow has been increasing over the years, with a significant increase in 2023. This suggests that the company is generating more cash from its operations.\\n5. **Gearing**: The gearing ratio has been decreasing over the years, indicating that the company's debt levels have decreased.\\n6. **PE (Price-to-Earnings) Ratio**: The PE ratio has been declining over the years, from 51.25 in 2019 to 56.28 in 2023. This suggests that the company's stock price is not as expensive as it was in the past.\\n7. **PB (Price-to-Book) Ratio**: The PB ratio has also been declining, from 8.47 in 2019 to 7.53 in 2023. This indicates that the company's stock price is not as expensive as its book value.\\n\\nOverall, the annual summary financial table suggests that Vitrox's financial performance has been relatively stable over the years, with some fluctuations. However, the declining ROE and EPS trends indicate that the company may be facing challenges in generating returns on its equity and earnings per share.

It peaks at 28.9% in 2014 and drops to 22.32% in 2023.\\n\\n3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**\\n   - EPS increases significantly from 21.14 in 2014 to 35.94 in 2021, but declines to 13.57 by 2023, reflecting the drop in net profit and possibly increased shares.\\n\\n4. **Return on Equity (ROE):**\\n   - ROE experiences significant fluctuation, with a peak of 49.59 in 2016, but falls to 13.38 by 2023.\\n\\n5. **Price-to-Earnings (PE) Ratio:**\\n   - The PE ratio shows volatility, peaking at 76.79 in 2020, which suggests high market expectations or stock price relative to earnings during that period.\\n\\n6. **Price-to-Book (PB) Ratio:**\\n   - PB ratio also fluctuates, peaking at 14.27 in 2020, indicating higher market valuation compared to the company's book value.\\n\\n7. **Dividends and Dividend Yield:**\\n   - Dividends per share (DPS) see minor changes, with slight increases over the years. The dividend yield remains relatively low, fluctuating around 0.26% to 1.7%.\\n\\n8. **Net Tangible Assets (NTA):**\\n   - NTA per share increases from 0.75 in 2014 to 1.51 in 2021, reflecting the company’s asset growth, but then decreases to 1.01 by 2023.\\n\\n9. **Total Number of Shares:**\\n   - There is a significant increase in the number of shares from 234,064 in 2016 to 945,351 in 2023, indicating possible capital raising or stock splits.\\n\\n**Overall Analysis:**\\nVitrox experienced strong growth in revenue and net profit over the years, with some volatility in profitability metrics like ROE and net profit margin.

Post this period, net profits began to decline, with notable drops by 31/12/2023.\\n   - The net profit margin fluctuated but remained relatively strong until 30/09/2023, after which it showed a decline, indicating pressures on profitability.\\n\\n3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:\\n   - EPS mirrored net profit trends, peaking at 10.73 in 30/06/2021. Thereafter, it declined, reflecting the drop in profitability.\\n\\n4. **Dividends Per Share (DPS)**:\\n   - DPS was variable, with several quarters showing no dividends, especially in the more recent quarters, possibly indicating retained earnings or cash flow management strategies.\\n\\n5. **Net Tangible Assets (NTA)**:\\n   - NTA increased steadily until 31/12/2021, suggesting asset growth. However, there was a notable drop by 31/03/2022, suggesting possible asset revaluation or write-downs.\\n\\nOverall, while Vitrox showed strong growth initially, recent quarters indicate challenges in maintaining revenue and profitability, potentially due to market conditions or internal factors.

This suggests variability in dividend payments, which might be a concern for income-focused investors.\\n\\n2. **Dividend Yield (DY)**: At 0.45, the DY is well below the 4% threshold, resulting in a FAIL. This low yield might make Vitrox less attractive to investors seeking regular income through dividends.\\n\\n3. **Operating Cash Flow**: The company passes this criterion (4/4), indicating a consistently positive operating cash flow, which is a positive sign of its ability to generate cash from operations.\\n\\n4. **Cash Flow Evaluation**: Failing the cash flow evaluation (0/4) indicates that the company's ability to convert operating income into actual cash is weak. This might suggest issues with earnings quality or cash management.\\n\\n5. **Total Debt Level**: The company exhibits a healthy reduction in total debt by -35.02% over four years, which is positive for financial health, reducing financial risk.\\n\\n6. **Receivable Level**: A decrease of -8.28% in receivables over four years is a positive trend, indicating improved efficiency in collecting payments.\\n\\n7. **Revenue & Profit**: Both revenue and net profit have declined over four years (-18.18% and -17.68%, respectively). This trend is concerning as it suggests shrinking business performance and profitability.\\n\\n**Recommendations for Potential Investors**:\\n- **Risk-Averse Investors**: The declining revenue and net profit, along with inconsistent dividend payouts, might deter risk-averse investors. The low dividend yield makes it less appealing for those seeking income.\\n- **Growth-Oriented Investors**: Investors looking for growth might be cautious due to the declining revenue and profit trends. However, the reduction in debt and positive operating cash flow could be seen as stabilizing factors.\\n- **Income Investors**: Given the low DY and inconsistent DPR, income investors may want to look elsewhere unless there is an expectation of dividend policy improvement.\\n\\n**Overall Financial Health and Outlook**:\\nVitrox shows mixed financial health. While it maintains positive operating cash flow and reduces debt, its revenue and profit are declining, and its ability to convert income to cash is weak. The low dividend yield and inconsistent payout further add to the concerns.

Without the actual dividend per share, this can't be precisely calculated.\\n- **Price Movement Implications:** If investors expect a higher yield, the stock price might decrease unless accompanied by a higher dividend payout.

        " \"The price–earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's valuation by dividing its current share price by its earnings per share (EPS). It helps investors determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its earnings. For example, if a stock is trading at $24 and its EPS is $3, the P/E ratio would be 8. This means investors are willing to pay $8 for every dollar of earnings, and it takes 8 years to recoup the investment in earnings. A P/E ratio around 20 is often considered 'fairly valued' by investors.\"]"

News link: https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/1439437\\nNews: Forex gains and losses dominate 3Q reporting seasonThis article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on December 2, 2024 - December 8, 2024FROM snack food makers to semiconductor players, many companies incurred foreign exchange (forex) losses in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2024.The forex losses can be attributed to the sharp appreciation of the ringgit in the third quarter of this year. As the local currency climbed 12.5% against the US dollar to 4.12 from 4.72 during the quarter, companies — especially those who are export-oriented or with assets overseas — saw their earnings take a hit.Some companies even fell into the red due to the forex losses. These included Kek Seng (M) Bhd (KL:KSENG), which is in the business of oil palm plantations, property and hotels. Its integrated plantations and property development and investment businesses are located in Malaysia, while its hotel segment consists of assets in the US and Canada.The company posted a net loss of RM36.66 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3QFY2024) as it was dragged down by unrealised forex losses amounting to a whopping RM81.84 million. This was its first quarterly net loss since 4QFY2020.Food packaging company Can-One Bhd (KL:CANONE) saw its net loss widen to RM100.54 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3Q2024) from RM23.12 million previously, on unrealised forex losses amounting to RM80.6 million. The silver lining is that its revenue grew 8.93% year on year (y-o-y) to RM793.46 million during the quarter as it had greater revenue recognition from general packaging, contract manufacturing and its property development division.Big cap IJM Corp Bhd (KL:IJM) saw its earnings dragged down by a substantial amount of unrealised forex losses, amounting to RM70 million, in the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (2QFY2025), which was almost equal to the group’s earnings for the quarter.IJM’s forex losses were related to its overseas property development and tollway operations in India. The conglomerate’s net profit for 2QFY2025 slipped 20.8% to RM74.21 million from a year earlier.The group says that after excluding the effects of the forex movements and fair value gain of RM1.3 million for 2QFY2025, its pre-tax profit would have decreased only marginally by 2.9% for the quarter.With many companies’ earnings hurt by forex losses, should investors be concerned about this phenomenon? It depends, say market experts, adding that forex fluctuations are part and parcel of international business that can work both ways.“A loss is a loss. However, there is a need to differentiate between realised and unrealised losses. Unrealised losses, which could be due to revaluation of foreign assets or liabilities, can be recovered when the currency movement direction is reversed,” says TA Investment chief investment officer Choo Swee Kee.UOB Kay Hian head of research Vincent Khoo opines that the forex losses recorded this time are “one-off” in nature as they are related to the sharp appreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar in 3Q. “The ringgit has since weakened,” he says, adding that the trend of forex losses is not likely to carry on into 4Q.Market experts say companies should be able to book forex gains if the ringgit, now hovering at 4.44, remains at current levels.At the same time, there was a handful of companies that saw their earnings propped up by a massive amount of forex gains in 3Q as a result of US dollar loans recording positive forex translation gains. Three companies stood out — Capital A Bhd (KL:CAPITALA), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (KL:TENAGA) and Axiata Group Bhd (KL:AXIATA).Capital A swung back into the black in 3QFY2024, with a net profit of RM1.6 billion from a net loss of RM102.7 million a year earlier. Its performance was largely due to unrealised forex gains of RM2.2 billion recorded during the quarter.Axiata had a dramatic turnaround with a net profit of RM951 million in 3Q2024, from a net loss of RM797.41 million in 3Q2023, on account of its unrealised forex gain of RM1.03 billion.Meanwhile, Tenaga registered a forex gain of RM1.1 billion for 3Q2024, which lifted its net profit to RM1.6 billion, an 85% y-o-y increase and a 10% gain quarter on quarter (q-o-q).According to CSG-CIMB Research, if the forex gains were stripped out, along with other smaller one-off items, the utility company would have reported a q-o-q decline of 57% in net profit for 3Q2024 on seasonally higher overhead-related expenses during the quarter, which was further exacerbated by higher “other” operating costs.Besides forex gains and losses, another noticeable trend that emerged in the 3Q earnings was special dividends, which is likely a move to pay out dividends before the 2% dividend tax takes effect in 2025.Companies that paid out a substantial amount in special dividends this quarter include Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd (KL:MSC), Lysaght Galvanised Steel Bhd (KL:LYSAGHT) and MBM Resources Bhd (KL:MBMR).Lysaght stands as the company that declared the highest amount of special dividend in 3QFY2024, with a whopping 35 sen per share for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2024 (FY2024), which will be paid out on Dec 9. Together with an interim dividend of eight sen per share, its shareholders will have received a total dividend of 43 sen per share to date for FY2024.MBM Resources dished out a special dividend of 22 sen per share to its shareholders for 3QFY2024 — the second time for FY2024. It has paid out so far two interim dividends amounting to 13 sen and a special dividend of 10 sen in 2QFY2024. This brings its total dividends to 45 sen for FY2024, with one more quarter to go.Meanwhile, MSC will pay out its first special dividend since its listing. It announced a special dividend of 17 sen per share for FY2024 that will be paid out on Dec 23. It also announced an interim dividend of seven sen per share, bringing the total dividend declared to 24 sen for FY2024.It was interesting to note that Chin Teck Plantations Bhd (KL:CHINTEK) brought forward its dividend payment. The plantation company declared a special dividend of seven sen per share as well as a first interim dividend of eight sen per share for its financial year ending Aug 31, 2025 (FY2025). The dividends, which were announced prior to the conclusion of its first quarter ending Nov 30, will be paid on Dec 27.Overall, heads of research contacted by The Edge say their preliminary assessment shows that about half of the companies under their coverage saw 3Q earnings in line with expectations. However, there were more companies that came in below expectations compared to those who exceeded expectations.One head of research mentions that revenue in 3Q had generally improved on both y-o-y and q-o-q basis, pointing to better business undertones.There were a few disappointments among the FBM KLCI component stocks, which led to an underwhelming 3Q earnings season, according to CIMB Securities in its Nov 29 report.The net earnings of the benchmark index constituents in 3Q amounted to RM19.23 billion, a growth of 11.4% y-o-y and 2.9% q-o-q. Of the 30 component stocks, 17 saw improved earnings for the quarter compared with the previous year while 13 reported lower earnings.Leading the pack in weaker earnings for the quarter is Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (KL:PCHEM), which fell into a net loss for the first time since its listing more than 10 years ago.PetChem’s net loss for 3QFY2024 amounted to RM789 million, with its unrealised forex losses amounting to RM1.1 billion, without which it would have made an estimated net profit of RM352 million. The group’s earnings were affected by the sharp depreciation of the US dollar, mainly due to its investment in Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd (PPC).Maybank Investment Bank Research said in its report that the group’s cumulative nine months’ earnings for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (9MFY2024) at RM750 million came in below expectations at 72% of its full-year estimate.The research house said PetChem had started to recognise its 50% portion of PPC’s operating costs in 3Q2024, comprising RM300 million in interest expense and RM400 million in depreciation annually. It opines that PPC will be loss-making for the next three years. It has a “sell” call on the stock and lowered its 12-month target price to RM3.82 from RM4.18 previously.Integrated plantations company Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KL:KLK) did not fare well this quarter (4QFY2024 ended Sept 30), reporting a net profit of RM6.77 million, a sharp decline of 94.18% from a year earlier. Its lower net profit was a result of lower downstream margins and increased losses at its associate companies.In contrast, IOI Corp Bhd (KL:IOICORP) posted a 133.8% increase in net profit for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (1QFY2025) to RM710.7 million from a year earlier.The company’s earnings were lifted by forex gains from its US dollar-denominated borrowings on the back of a strengthening ringgit in 3Q and fair value adjustments to its biological assets and derivative financial instruments. Excluding the RM449.5 million gain from one-off non-operating items, of which RM365.9 million was a net forex gain, its underlying profit before tax for 1QFY2025 was up 4% to RM359.1 million from RM344.4 million.Meanwhile, Genting Malaysia Bhd (KL:GENM) saw its 3QFY2024 net profit jump threefold from a year earlier on net unrealised forex gains amounting to RM601.8 million on its US-dollar denominated borrowings.The group’s net profit amounted to RM569.16 million for 3QFY2024 — the highest quarterly profit in almost six years — compared with RM177.41 million in 3QFY2023. However, if the impact of forex gains were excluded, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) would have been down 6%.Sunway Bhd (KL:SUNWAY) saw its net earnings increase 108% y-o-y to RM376.08 million on the back of stronger operating performance across its core businesses. It is the only company on the FBM KLCI to see its earnings double or more that was not propped up by unrealised forex gains in 3Q.Instead, its earnings were lifted by the recognition of an accumulated development profit of about RM124 million from its executive condominium development Parc Central Residences in Singapore.More energy companies reported improved earnings on a y-o-y basis in 3Q. Companies in the offshore support vessel (OSV) segment, such as Keyfield International Bhd (KL:KEYFIELD), Perdana Petroleum Bhd (KL:PERDANA) and Icon Offshore Bhd (KL:ICON) saw 3QFY2024 net profit improve at least three times from a year earlier.Keyfield chalked up a net profit of RM81.11 million for 3QFY2024, up six times from a year earlier, while Perdana’s net profit improved 3.3 times to RM75.8 million and Icon saw its net profit increase three times to RM19.43 million.The improvement in net profit was driven by better daily charter rates. Perdana and Keyfield also attributed the improvement in earnings to better utilisation of vessels, whereas Icon said utilisation fell to 78% from 86% in 3QFY2023 due to unplanned maintenance.Owner and operator of jack-up rigs Velesto Energy Bhd’s (KL:VELESTO) earnings for 3QFY2024 improved more than three times to RM42.93 million compared with the previous corresponding quarter. The improvement was attributed to higher utilisation and average daily charter rates for jack-up rigs.Meanwhile, fabrication company Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Bhd (KL:MHB) swung back into the black with a net profit of RM15.27 million for 3QFY2024 from a net loss of RM105.21 million a year earlier. It attributed the better performance to both its heavy engineering and marine segments.Interestingly, as a sector, the Bursa Malaysia Energy Index has not gained much this year. It has trended downwards since hitting a year high of 1,012.24 points on June 13. At 811.66 points on Nov 29, it was 0.74% lower than at the start of the year.All banks listed on Bursa saw a y-o-y improvement in net profit in the third quarter, save for Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (KL:BIMB), whose net profit fell 7.2% y-o-y to RM130.44 million.Notably, Affin Bank Bhd recorded the largest percentage increase in quarterly net profit, up 45% to RM145.82 million from a year earlier on higher interest income and income from its Islamic banking business. The banking group also saw higher write-back of credit impairment losses and higher net forex gains during the quarter.Meanwhile, RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK) posted a 28% y-o-y growth in its net profit, amounting to RM833.19 million, in 3QFY2024. The increase was attributed to sharp currency gains that lifted its non-interest income by RM659.86 million.Net income for the quarter stood at RM996.78 million, an 8.8% y-o-y increase, whereas other operating income doubled to RM1.045 billion on account of net forex gains.Many would agree that the most underwhelming earnings results for the quarter came from the technology sector as semiconductor companies are still waiting for the cycle to turn.Oppstar Bhd (KL:OPPSTAR) reported a net loss of RM1.73 million for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (2QFY2025). This was despite a higher revenue of RM21.72 million, up 54.8% y-o-y. The company made a net profit of RM4 million in the previous corresponding quarter.Oppstar, which is in the business of integrated circuit design, says its loss was mainly due to an increase in administrative expenses and a decline in other income.Another semiconductor-related company that made a loss during the quarter was Mi Technovation Bhd (KL:MI). It reported a net loss of RM7.2 million for 3QFY2024, compared with a net profit of RM14.16 million in the previous year, primarily due to a substantial unrealised forex loss in the quarter.In the company’s financial statements, it mentioned that it foresees the ringgit further strengthening by the end of 4Q. As a result, its board is of the view that the group’s net profit for FY2024 will come under pressure from unrealised forex losses and higher research and development expenditure. It added that it would take measures to effectively mitigate the forex risk.The automated test equipment manufacturers as well as the packing and testing companies in the electrical and electronics supply chain did not fare well in 3Q, with many posting weaker earnings than a year earlier. These include ViTrox Corp Bhd (KL:VITROX), Pentamaster Corp Bhd (KL:PENTA), Greatech Technologies Bhd (KL:GREATEC) and Inari Amertron Bhd (KL:INARI).While many languished, there were some that saw improved earnings during the quarter. Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (KL:MPI) saw its net profit increase 82.4% y-o-y to RM30.13 million in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (1QFY2025). The company says the better performance was a result of its higher revenue, which inched up 0.6% to RM516.57 million, and lower operating expenses incurred during the quarter.Meanwhile, Unisem (M) Bhd’s (KL:UNISEM) 3QFY2024 net profit increased to RM26.75 million, up 48.5% from a year earlier, on the back of better revenue and forex gains made during the quarter. The increase in revenue and net profit was mainly attributed to higher sales volume and forex gains, as opposed to forex losses in the previous corresponding period.\\n\\n2.

News link: https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/1442079\\nNews: Broadcom forecasts Q1 revenue above estimates on strong AI chip demandBroadcom forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday and predicted booming demand for its custom artificial intelligence chips in the next few years.Shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company were up 14% in aftermaket trade after CEO Hock Tan told investors on a conference call he expects a revenue opportunity from AI in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.Tan indicated three \"hyperscale\" customers are likely to deploy millions of AI chip clusters at the time.Big tech has been vying to reduce its dependence of pricey, supply-constrained AI processors made by front-runner Nvidia , helping Broadcom which makes advanced custom artificial intelligence chips for so-called hyperscalers.Demand for Broadcom\\'s networking chips that help move around vast amounts of data used by applications such as OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT has also increased, as businesses double down on investments in GenAI infrastructure.\"Broadcom\\'s strong performance doesn\\'t come as a surprise. It\\'s one of several companies benefiting from AI invigorating the global semiconductor industry, with its AI revenue growing 220% this year,\" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.The company forecast revenue of about $14.6 billion for the first quarter, compared with analysts\\' average estimate of $14.57 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.Analysts, however, have raised doubts about the amount of potential future business from Apple, one of Broadcom\\'s most significant wireless customers, as the iPhone maker works to design more of its chips in-house.Apple\\'s plans will include switching to a homegrown chip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections starting next year, replacing some parts currently provided by Broadcom, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Thursday.Though the company faces intense competition from Nvidia\\'s ethernet-like Infiniband products, Broadcom still benefits from the expansion of AI data centers as it is one of the largest providers of advanced networking equipment.\"Broadcom will continue to be a relevant player in the custom AI ASIC market together with companies like Marvell as tier-1 hyperscalers will continue to introduce their in-house chips,\" Summit Insights senior analyst Kinngai Chan said.Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASICs, are chips designed for specific tasks or applications.While hailed as a chipmaker, Broadcom has proliferated into a tech conglomerate owing to buyouts such as its $69 billion acquisition of cloud-computing firm VMware. The infrastructure software segment grew 196% from a year earlier to $5.82 billion in the fourth quarter.The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $14.05 billion, a jump of over 50% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected $14.09 billion.On an adjusted basis, Broadcom earned $1.42 per share compared with estimates of $1.38 per share.\\n\\n3.

        " ['Page: Price–earnings ratio\\nSummary: The price–earnings ratio, also known as P/E ratio, P/E, or PER, is the ratio of a company\\'s share (stock) price to the company\\'s earnings per share. The ratio is used for valuing companies and to find out whether they are overvalued or undervalued. \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          P/E\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            Share Price\\n            Earnings per Share\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{P/E}}={\\\\frac {\\\\text{Share Price}}{\\\\text{Earnings per Share}}}}\\n  \\n\\nAs an example, if share A is trading at $24 and the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period is $3, then share A has a P/E ratio of \\u2060$24/$3/year\\u2060 = 8 years. Put another way, the purchaser of the share is investing $8 years to recoup the share price. Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as \"not applicable\" or \"N/A\"); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown. There is a general consensus among most investors that a P/E ratio of around 20 is \\'fairly valued\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio\\nSummary: The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, commonly known as CAPE, Shiller P/E, or P/E 10 ratio, is a stock valuation measure usually applied to the US S&P 500 equity market. It is defined as price divided by the average of ten years of earnings (moving average), adjusted for inflation. As such, it is principally used to assess likely future returns from equities over timescales of 10 to 20 years, with higher than average CAPE values implying lower than average long-term annual average returns. \\n\\n The ratio was invented by American economist Robert J. Shiller.\\nThe ratio is used to gauge whether a stock, or group of stocks, is undervalued or overvalued by comparing its current market price to its inflation-adjusted historical earnings record.\\nIt is a variant of the more popular price to earning ratio and is calculated by dividing the current price of a stock by its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years.\\nUsing average earnings over the last decade helps to smooth out the impact of business cycles and other events and gives a better picture of a company\\'s sustainable earning power.\\nIt is not intended as an indicator of impending market crashes, although high CAPE values have been associated with such events.\\n\\nPage: PEG ratio\\nSummary: The \\'PEG ratio\\' (price/earnings to growth ratio) is a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company\\'s expected growth.\\nIn general, the P/E ratio is higher for a company with a higher growth rate. Thus, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. It is assumed that by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is better for comparing companies with different growth rates.\\nThe PEG ratio is considered to be a convenient approximation. It was originally developed by Mario Farina who wrote about it in his 1969 Book, A Beginner\\'s Guide To Successful Investing In The Stock Market. It was later popularized by Peter Lynch, who wrote in his 1989 book One Up on Wall Street that \"The P/E ratio of any company that\\'s fairly priced will equal its growth rate\", i.e., a fairly valued company will have its PEG equal to 1.  The formula can be supported theoretically by reference to the Sum of perpetuities method.\\n\\n']]"

        " 'The Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) is a valuation metric that compares a company\\'s share price to its earnings per share. It is calculated by dividing the share price by the earnings per share and is used to determine whether a company is overvalued or undervalued.\\n\\nA higher P/E ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings, while a lower P/E ratio suggests that investors are paying less for each dollar of earnings. The ideal P/E ratio varies depending on the industry, market conditions, and other factors.\\n\\nThere are different types of P/E ratios, including:\\n\\n1. **Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio (CAPE)**: This ratio is used to assess likely future returns from equities over timescales of 10 to 20 years. It is calculated by dividing the current price by the average of ten years of earnings, adjusted for inflation.\\n2. **PEG Ratio**: This ratio compares the P/E ratio to the company\\'s expected growth rate. It is considered a convenient approximation and can help investors compare companies with different growth rates.\\n\\nA general rule of thumb is that a P/E ratio of around 20 is considered \"fairly valued.\" However, this can vary depending on the industry and market conditions.\\n\\nIn summary, the P/E Ratio is an important metric for evaluating a company\\'s valuation and making informed investment decisions.']"

Post this period, net profits began to decline, with notable drops by 31/12/2023.\\n   - The net profit margin fluctuated but remained relatively strong until 30/09/2023, after which it showed a decline, indicating pressures on profitability.\\n\\n3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:\\n   - EPS mirrored net profit trends, peaking at 10.73 in 30/06/2021.

This suggests variability in dividend payments, which might be a concern for income-focused investors.\\n\\n2. **Dividend Yield (DY)**: At 0.45, the DY is well below the 4% threshold, resulting in a FAIL. This low yield might make Vitrox less attractive to investors seeking regular income through dividends.\\n\\n3. **Operating Cash Flow**: The company passes this criterion (4/4), indicating a consistently positive operating cash flow, which is a positive sign of its ability to generate cash from operations.\\n\\n4. **Cash Flow Evaluation**: Failing the cash flow evaluation (0/4) indicates that the company's ability to convert operating income into actual cash is weak. This might suggest issues with earnings quality or cash management.\\n\\n5. **Total Debt Level**: The company exhibits a healthy reduction in total debt by -35.02% over four years, which is positive for financial health, reducing financial risk.\\n\\n6. **Receivable Level**: A decrease of -8.28% in receivables over four years is a positive trend, indicating improved efficiency in collecting payments.\\n\\n7. **Revenue & Profit**: Both revenue and net profit have declined over four years (-18.18% and -17.68%, respectively). This trend is concerning as it suggests shrinking business performance and profitability.\\n\\n**Recommendations for Potential Investors**:\\n- **Risk-Averse Investors**: The declining revenue and net profit, along with inconsistent dividend payouts, might deter risk-averse investors. The low dividend yield makes it less appealing for those seeking income.\\n- **Growth-Oriented Investors**: Investors looking for growth might be cautious due to the declining revenue and profit trends. However, the reduction in debt and positive operating cash flow could be seen as stabilizing factors.\\n- **Income Investors**: Given the low DY and inconsistent DPR, income investors may want to look elsewhere unless there is an expectation of dividend policy improvement.\\n\\n**Overall Financial Health and Outlook**:\\nVitrox shows mixed financial health. While it maintains positive operating cash flow and reduces debt, its revenue and profit are declining, and its ability to convert income to cash is weak. The low dividend yield and inconsistent payout further add to the concerns. The company may need to focus on reversing revenue and profit declines and improving cash conversion to enhance its financial outlook.\",\n",

It is calculated by dividing the current market price of a stock by its earnings per share over a specific period, usually 12 months. The resulting number represents how many years it would take for an investor to recoup their investment based on the company's earnings.\\n\\nThe PE ratio can be used as a valuation tool to determine whether a company is overvalued or undervalued compared to its peers. A higher PE ratio indicates that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings, while a lower PE ratio suggests that investors are less enthusiastic about the company's prospects.\\n\\nThere are different types of PE ratios, including:\\n\\n1. CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio): This is a variant of the PE ratio that takes into account inflation and uses 10-year average earnings to smooth out business cycles.\\n2. PEG (Price/Earnings to Growth) Ratio: This metric adjusts the PE ratio for a company's expected growth rate, making it easier to compare companies with different growth prospects.\\n\\nOverall, the PE ratio is an important tool for investors to assess a company's value and make informed decisions about their investments.\"]"

News link: https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/1439437\\nNews: Forex gains and losses dominate 3Q reporting seasonThis article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on December 2, 2024 - December 8, 2024FROM snack food makers to semiconductor players, many companies incurred foreign exchange (forex) losses in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2024.The forex losses can be attributed to the sharp appreciation of the ringgit in the third quarter of this year. As the local currency climbed 12.5% against the US dollar to 4.12 from 4.72 during the quarter, companies — especially those who are export-oriented or with assets overseas — saw their earnings take a hit.Some companies even fell into the red due to the forex losses. These included Kek Seng (M) Bhd (KL:KSENG), which is in the business of oil palm plantations, property and hotels. Its integrated plantations and property development and investment businesses are located in Malaysia, while its hotel segment consists of assets in the US and Canada.The company posted a net loss of RM36.66 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3QFY2024) as it was dragged down by unrealised forex losses amounting to a whopping RM81.84 million. This was its first quarterly net loss since 4QFY2020.Food packaging company Can-One Bhd (KL:CANONE) saw its net loss widen to RM100.54 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3Q2024) from RM23.12 million previously, on unrealised forex losses amounting to RM80.6 million. The silver lining is that its revenue grew 8.93% year on year (y-o-y) to RM793.46 million during the quarter as it had greater revenue recognition from general packaging, contract manufacturing and its property development division.Big cap IJM Corp Bhd (KL:IJM) saw its earnings dragged down by a substantial amount of unrealised forex losses, amounting to RM70 million, in the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (2QFY2025), which was almost equal to the group’s earnings for the quarter.IJM’s forex losses were related to its overseas property development and tollway operations in India. The conglomerate’s net profit for 2QFY2025 slipped 20.8% to RM74.21 million from a year earlier.The group says that after excluding the effects of the forex movements and fair value gain of RM1.3 million for 2QFY2025, its pre-tax profit would have decreased only marginally by 2.9% for the quarter.With many companies’ earnings hurt by forex losses, should investors be concerned about this phenomenon? It depends, say market experts, adding that forex fluctuations are part and parcel of international business that can work both ways.“A loss is a loss. However, there is a need to differentiate between realised and unrealised losses. Unrealised losses, which could be due to revaluation of foreign assets or liabilities, can be recovered when the currency movement direction is reversed,” says TA Investment chief investment officer Choo Swee Kee.UOB Kay Hian head of research Vincent Khoo opines that the forex losses recorded this time are “one-off” in nature as they are related to the sharp appreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar in 3Q. “The ringgit has since weakened,” he says, adding that the trend of forex losses is not likely to carry on into 4Q.Market experts say companies should be able to book forex gains if the ringgit, now hovering at 4.44, remains at current levels.At the same time, there was a handful of companies that saw their earnings propped up by a massive amount of forex gains in 3Q as a result of US dollar loans recording positive forex translation gains. Three companies stood out — Capital A Bhd (KL:CAPITALA), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (KL:TENAGA) and Axiata Group Bhd (KL:AXIATA).Capital A swung back into the black in 3QFY2024, with a net profit of RM1.6 billion from a net loss of RM102.7 million a year earlier. Its performance was largely due to unrealised forex gains of RM2.2 billion recorded during the quarter.Axiata had a dramatic turnaround with a net profit of RM951 million in 3Q2024, from a net loss of RM797.41 million in 3Q2023, on account of its unrealised forex gain of RM1.03 billion.Meanwhile, Tenaga registered a forex gain of RM1.1 billion for 3Q2024, which lifted its net profit to RM1.6 billion, an 85% y-o-y increase and a 10% gain quarter on quarter (q-o-q).According to CSG-CIMB Research, if the forex gains were stripped out, along with other smaller one-off items, the utility company would have reported a q-o-q decline of 57% in net profit for 3Q2024 on seasonally higher overhead-related expenses during the quarter, which was further exacerbated by higher “other” operating costs.Besides forex gains and losses, another noticeable trend that emerged in the 3Q earnings was special dividends, which is likely a move to pay out dividends before the 2% dividend tax takes effect in 2025.Companies that paid out a substantial amount in special dividends this quarter include Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd (KL:MSC), Lysaght Galvanised Steel Bhd (KL:LYSAGHT) and MBM Resources Bhd (KL:MBMR).Lysaght stands as the company that declared the highest amount of special dividend in 3QFY2024, with a whopping 35 sen per share for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2024 (FY2024), which will be paid out on Dec 9. Together with an interim dividend of eight sen per share, its shareholders will have received a total dividend of 43 sen per share to date for FY2024.MBM Resources dished out a special dividend of 22 sen per share to its shareholders for 3QFY2024 — the second time for FY2024. It has paid out so far two interim dividends amounting to 13 sen and a special dividend of 10 sen in 2QFY2024. This brings its total dividends to 45 sen for FY2024, with one more quarter to go.Meanwhile, MSC will pay out its first special dividend since its listing. It announced a special dividend of 17 sen per share for FY2024 that will be paid out on Dec 23. It also announced an interim dividend of seven sen per share, bringing the total dividend declared to 24 sen for FY2024.It was interesting to note that Chin Teck Plantations Bhd (KL:CHINTEK) brought forward its dividend payment. The plantation company declared a special dividend of seven sen per share as well as a first interim dividend of eight sen per share for its financial year ending Aug 31, 2025 (FY2025). The dividends, which were announced prior to the conclusion of its first quarter ending Nov 30, will be paid on Dec 27.Overall, heads of research contacted by The Edge say their preliminary assessment shows that about half of the companies under their coverage saw 3Q earnings in line with expectations. However, there were more companies that came in below expectations compared to those who exceeded expectations.One head of research mentions that revenue in 3Q had generally improved on both y-o-y and q-o-q basis, pointing to better business undertones.There were a few disappointments among the FBM KLCI component stocks, which led to an underwhelming 3Q earnings season, according to CIMB Securities in its Nov 29 report.The net earnings of the benchmark index constituents in 3Q amounted to RM19.23 billion, a growth of 11.4% y-o-y and 2.9% q-o-q. Of the 30 component stocks, 17 saw improved earnings for the quarter compared with the previous year while 13 reported lower earnings.Leading the pack in weaker earnings for the quarter is Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (KL:PCHEM), which fell into a net loss for the first time since its listing more than 10 years ago.PetChem’s net loss for 3QFY2024 amounted to RM789 million, with its unrealised forex losses amounting to RM1.1 billion, without which it would have made an estimated net profit of RM352 million. The group’s earnings were affected by the sharp depreciation of the US dollar, mainly due to its investment in Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd (PPC).Maybank Investment Bank Research said in its report that the group’s cumulative nine months’ earnings for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (9MFY2024) at RM750 million came in below expectations at 72% of its full-year estimate.The research house said PetChem had started to recognise its 50% portion of PPC’s operating costs in 3Q2024, comprising RM300 million in interest expense and RM400 million in depreciation annually. It opines that PPC will be loss-making for the next three years. It has a “sell” call on the stock and lowered its 12-month target price to RM3.82 from RM4.18 previously.Integrated plantations company Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KL:KLK) did not fare well this quarter (4QFY2024 ended Sept 30), reporting a net profit of RM6.77 million, a sharp decline of 94.18% from a year earlier. Its lower net profit was a result of lower downstream margins and increased losses at its associate companies.In contrast, IOI Corp Bhd (KL:IOICORP) posted a 133.8% increase in net profit for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (1QFY2025) to RM710.7 million from a year earlier.The company’s earnings were lifted by forex gains from its US dollar-denominated borrowings on the back of a strengthening ringgit in 3Q and fair value adjustments to its biological assets and derivative financial instruments. Excluding the RM449.5 million gain from one-off non-operating items, of which RM365.9 million was a net forex gain, its underlying profit before tax for 1QFY2025 was up 4% to RM359.1 million from RM344.4 million.Meanwhile, Genting Malaysia Bhd (KL:GENM) saw its 3QFY2024 net profit jump threefold from a year earlier on net unrealised forex gains amounting to RM601.8 million on its US-dollar denominated borrowings.The group’s net profit amounted to RM569.16 million for 3QFY2024 — the highest quarterly profit in almost six years — compared with RM177.41 million in 3QFY2023. However, if the impact of forex gains were excluded, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) would have been down 6%.Sunway Bhd (KL:SUNWAY) saw its net earnings increase 108% y-o-y to RM376.08 million on the back of stronger operating performance across its core businesses. It is the only company on the FBM KLCI to see its earnings double or more that was not propped up by unrealised forex gains in 3Q.Instead, its earnings were lifted by the recognition of an accumulated development profit of about RM124 million from its executive condominium development Parc Central Residences in Singapore.More energy companies reported improved earnings on a y-o-y basis in 3Q. Companies in the offshore support vessel (OSV) segment, such as Keyfield International Bhd (KL:KEYFIELD), Perdana Petroleum Bhd (KL:PERDANA) and Icon Offshore Bhd (KL:ICON) saw 3QFY2024 net profit improve at least three times from a year earlier.Keyfield chalked up a net profit of RM81.11 million for 3QFY2024, up six times from a year earlier, while Perdana’s net profit improved 3.3 times to RM75.8 million and Icon saw its net profit increase three times to RM19.43 million.The improvement in net profit was driven by better daily charter rates. Perdana and Keyfield also attributed the improvement in earnings to better utilisation of vessels, whereas Icon said utilisation fell to 78% from 86% in 3QFY2023 due to unplanned maintenance.Owner and operator of jack-up rigs Velesto Energy Bhd’s (KL:VELESTO) earnings for 3QFY2024 improved more than three times to RM42.93 million compared with the previous corresponding quarter. The improvement was attributed to higher utilisation and average daily charter rates for jack-up rigs.Meanwhile, fabrication company Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Bhd (KL:MHB) swung back into the black with a net profit of RM15.27 million for 3QFY2024 from a net loss of RM105.21 million a year earlier. It attributed the better performance to both its heavy engineering and marine segments.Interestingly, as a sector, the Bursa Malaysia Energy Index has not gained much this year. It has trended downwards since hitting a year high of 1,012.24 points on June 13. At 811.66 points on Nov 29, it was 0.74% lower than at the start of the year.All banks listed on Bursa saw a y-o-y improvement in net profit in the third quarter, save for Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (KL:BIMB), whose net profit fell 7.2% y-o-y to RM130.44 million.Notably, Affin Bank Bhd recorded the largest percentage increase in quarterly net profit, up 45% to RM145.82 million from a year earlier on higher interest income and income from its Islamic banking business. The banking group also saw higher write-back of credit impairment losses and higher net forex gains during the quarter.Meanwhile, RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK) posted a 28% y-o-y growth in its net profit, amounting to RM833.19 million, in 3QFY2024. The increase was attributed to sharp currency gains that lifted its non-interest income by RM659.86 million.Net income for the quarter stood at RM996.78 million, an 8.8% y-o-y increase, whereas other operating income doubled to RM1.045 billion on account of net forex gains.Many would agree that the most underwhelming earnings results for the quarter came from the technology sector as semiconductor companies are still waiting for the cycle to turn.Oppstar Bhd (KL:OPPSTAR) reported a net loss of RM1.73 million for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (2QFY2025). This was despite a higher revenue of RM21.72 million, up 54.8% y-o-y. The company made a net profit of RM4 million in the previous corresponding quarter.Oppstar, which is in the business of integrated circuit design, says its loss was mainly due to an increase in administrative expenses and a decline in other income.Another semiconductor-related company that made a loss during the quarter was Mi Technovation Bhd (KL:MI). It reported a net loss of RM7.2 million for 3QFY2024, compared with a net profit of RM14.16 million in the previous year, primarily due to a substantial unrealised forex loss in the quarter.In the company’s financial statements, it mentioned that it foresees the ringgit further strengthening by the end of 4Q. As a result, its board is of the view that the group’s net profit for FY2024 will come under pressure from unrealised forex losses and higher research and development expenditure. It added that it would take measures to effectively mitigate the forex risk.The automated test equipment manufacturers as well as the packing and testing companies in the electrical and electronics supply chain did not fare well in 3Q, with many posting weaker earnings than a year earlier. These include ViTrox Corp Bhd (KL:VITROX), Pentamaster Corp Bhd (KL:PENTA), Greatech Technologies Bhd (KL:GREATEC) and Inari Amertron Bhd (KL:INARI).While many languished, there were some that saw improved earnings during the quarter. Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (KL:MPI) saw its net profit increase 82.4% y-o-y to RM30.13 million in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (1QFY2025). The company says the better performance was a result of its higher revenue, which inched up 0.6% to RM516.57 million, and lower operating expenses incurred during the quarter.Meanwhile, Unisem (M) Bhd’s (KL:UNISEM) 3QFY2024 net profit increased to RM26.75 million, up 48.5% from a year earlier, on the back of better revenue and forex gains made during the quarter. The increase in revenue and net profit was mainly attributed to higher sales volume and forex gains, as opposed to forex losses in the previous corresponding period.\\n\\n2.

News link: https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/1442079\\nNews: Broadcom forecasts Q1 revenue above estimates on strong AI chip demandBroadcom forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday and predicted booming demand for its custom artificial intelligence chips in the next few years.Shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company were up 14% in aftermaket trade after CEO Hock Tan told investors on a conference call he expects a revenue opportunity from AI in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.Tan indicated three \"hyperscale\" customers are likely to deploy millions of AI chip clusters at the time.Big tech has been vying to reduce its dependence of pricey, supply-constrained AI processors made by front-runner Nvidia , helping Broadcom which makes advanced custom artificial intelligence chips for so-called hyperscalers.Demand for Broadcom\\'s networking chips that help move around vast amounts of data used by applications such as OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT has also increased, as businesses double down on investments in GenAI infrastructure.\"Broadcom\\'s strong performance doesn\\'t come as a surprise. It\\'s one of several companies benefiting from AI invigorating the global semiconductor industry, with its AI revenue growing 220% this year,\" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.The company forecast revenue of about $14.6 billion for the first quarter, compared with analysts\\' average estimate of $14.57 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.Analysts, however, have raised doubts about the amount of potential future business from Apple, one of Broadcom\\'s most significant wireless customers, as the iPhone maker works to design more of its chips in-house.Apple\\'s plans will include switching to a homegrown chip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections starting next year, replacing some parts currently provided by Broadcom, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Thursday.Though the company faces intense competition from Nvidia\\'s ethernet-like Infiniband products, Broadcom still benefits from the expansion of AI data centers as it is one of the largest providers of advanced networking equipment.\"Broadcom will continue to be a relevant player in the custom AI ASIC market together with companies like Marvell as tier-1 hyperscalers will continue to introduce their in-house chips,\" Summit Insights senior analyst Kinngai Chan said.Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASICs, are chips designed for specific tasks or applications.While hailed as a chipmaker, Broadcom has proliferated into a tech conglomerate owing to buyouts such as its $69 billion acquisition of cloud-computing firm VMware. The infrastructure software segment grew 196% from a year earlier to $5.82 billion in the fourth quarter.The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $14.05 billion, a jump of over 50% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected $14.09 billion.On an adjusted basis, Broadcom earned $1.42 per share compared with estimates of $1.38 per share.\\n\\n3.

The ratio is used for valuing companies and to find out whether they are overvalued or undervalued. \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          P/E\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            Share Price\\n            Earnings per Share\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{P/E}}={\\\\frac {\\\\text{Share Price}}{\\\\text{Earnings per Share}}}}\\n  \\n\\nAs an example, if share A is trading at $24 and the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period is $3, then share A has a P/E ratio of \\u2060$24/$3/year\\u2060 = 8 years. Put another way, the purchaser of the share is investing $8 years to recoup the share price. Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as \"not applicable\" or \"N/A\"); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown. There is a general consensus among most investors that a P/E ratio of around 20 is \\'fairly valued\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio\\nSummary: The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, commonly known as CAPE, Shiller P/E, or P/E 10 ratio, is a stock valuation measure usually applied to the US S&P 500 equity market. It is defined as price divided by the average of ten years of earnings (moving average), adjusted for inflation. As such, it is principally used to assess likely future returns from equities over timescales of 10 to 20 years, with higher than average CAPE values implying lower than average long-term annual average returns. \\n\\n The ratio was invented by American economist Robert J. Shiller.\\nThe ratio is used to gauge whether a stock, or group of stocks, is undervalued or overvalued by comparing its current market price to its inflation-adjusted historical earnings record.\\nIt is a variant of the more popular price to earning ratio and is calculated by dividing the current price of a stock by its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years.\\nUsing average earnings over the last decade helps to smooth out the impact of business cycles and other events and gives a better picture of a company\\'s sustainable earning power.\\nIt is not intended as an indicator of impending market crashes, although high CAPE values have been associated with such events.\\n\\nPage: PEG ratio\\nSummary: The \\'PEG ratio\\' (price/earnings to growth ratio) is a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company\\'s expected growth.\\nIn general, the P/E ratio is higher for a company with a higher growth rate. Thus, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. It is assumed that by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is better for comparing companies with different growth rates.\\nThe PEG ratio is considered to be a convenient approximation. It was originally developed by Mario Farina who wrote about it in his 1969 Book, A Beginner\\'s Guide To Successful Investing In The Stock Market. It was later popularized by Peter Lynch, who wrote in his 1989 book One Up on Wall Street that \"The P/E ratio of any company that\\'s fairly priced will equal its growth rate\", i.e., a fairly valued company will have its PEG equal to 1.  The formula can be supported theoretically by reference to the Sum of perpetuities method.\\n\\n']]"

        " 'Based on the provided financial indicators, here\\'s an analysis of Vitrox\\'s competitive advantage:\\n\\n1. Market Capitalization (Market Cap): With a market cap of 6.72B, Vitrox falls under the Mid-Large Cap category. This indicates that the company is established and has a relatively strong market position, which can contribute to its competitive advantage. As a Mid-Large Cap stock, Vitrox is likely to have a more stable market presence compared to smaller-cap stocks, but its growth potential might be limited compared to smaller-cap stocks.\\n\\n2. Sector and Industry: Vitrox operates in the Technology sector, specifically in the Semiconductors industry. This sector is highly competitive, and companies need to continuously innovate to maintain their market position. Vitrox\\'s presence in this sector suggests that it has a strong understanding of the industry\\'s dynamics and is well-positioned to adapt to changing market conditions.\\n\\n3. Profit Margin (PM): Vitrox\\'s profit margin of 16.9% is significantly higher than the sector average of -2.0%. This indicates that the company has a strong cost advantage, pricing power, or a combination of both, which enables it to maintain higher profitability compared to its peers. A significantly higher PM is a positive indicator of Vitrox\\'s competitive advantage.\\n\\n4. Stability of Return on Equity (ROE): Vitrox\\'s ROE stability is categorized as \"Good\" with an average ROE of 9.37%. This suggests that the company is able to generate consistent shareholder value, which is a positive indicator of its competitive advantage. A stable ROE reflects Vitrox\\'s ability to maintain its market position and adapt to changing market conditions.\\n\\nOverall Assessment:\\nBased on the analysis of the financial indicators, Vitrox demonstrates a strong competitive advantage within its sector and the broader market.

Its ability to maintain high profitability, generate consistent shareholder value, and adapt to changing market conditions makes it an attractive investment opportunity.

        " ['1. News link: https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/1439437\\nNews: Forex gains and losses dominate 3Q reporting seasonThis article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on December 2, 2024 - December 8, 2024FROM snack food makers to semiconductor players, many companies incurred foreign exchange (forex) losses in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2024.The forex losses can be attributed to the sharp appreciation of the ringgit in the third quarter of this year. As the local currency climbed 12.5% against the US dollar to 4.12 from 4.72 during the quarter, companies — especially those who are export-oriented or with assets overseas — saw their earnings take a hit.Some companies even fell into the red due to the forex losses. These included Kek Seng (M) Bhd (KL:KSENG), which is in the business of oil palm plantations, property and hotels. Its integrated plantations and property development and investment businesses are located in Malaysia, while its hotel segment consists of assets in the US and Canada.The company posted a net loss of RM36.66 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3QFY2024) as it was dragged down by unrealised forex losses amounting to a whopping RM81.84 million. This was its first quarterly net loss since 4QFY2020.Food packaging company Can-One Bhd (KL:CANONE) saw its net loss widen to RM100.54 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30 (3Q2024) from RM23.12 million previously, on unrealised forex losses amounting to RM80.6 million. The silver lining is that its revenue grew 8.93% year on year (y-o-y) to RM793.46 million during the quarter as it had greater revenue recognition from general packaging, contract manufacturing and its property development division.Big cap IJM Corp Bhd (KL:IJM) saw its earnings dragged down by a substantial amount of unrealised forex losses, amounting to RM70 million, in the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (2QFY2025), which was almost equal to the group’s earnings for the quarter.IJM’s forex losses were related to its overseas property development and tollway operations in India. The conglomerate’s net profit for 2QFY2025 slipped 20.8% to RM74.21 million from a year earlier.The group says that after excluding the effects of the forex movements and fair value gain of RM1.3 million for 2QFY2025, its pre-tax profit would have decreased only marginally by 2.9% for the quarter.With many companies’ earnings hurt by forex losses, should investors be concerned about this phenomenon? It depends, say market experts, adding that forex fluctuations are part and parcel of international business that can work both ways.“A loss is a loss. However, there is a need to differentiate between realised and unrealised losses. Unrealised losses, which could be due to revaluation of foreign assets or liabilities, can be recovered when the currency movement direction is reversed,” says TA Investment chief investment officer Choo Swee Kee.UOB Kay Hian head of research Vincent Khoo opines that the forex losses recorded this time are “one-off” in nature as they are related to the sharp appreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar in 3Q. “The ringgit has since weakened,” he says, adding that the trend of forex losses is not likely to carry on into 4Q.Market experts say companies should be able to book forex gains if the ringgit, now hovering at 4.44, remains at current levels.At the same time, there was a handful of companies that saw their earnings propped up by a massive amount of forex gains in 3Q as a result of US dollar loans recording positive forex translation gains. Three companies stood out — Capital A Bhd (KL:CAPITALA), Tenaga Nasional Bhd (KL:TENAGA) and Axiata Group Bhd (KL:AXIATA).Capital A swung back into the black in 3QFY2024, with a net profit of RM1.6 billion from a net loss of RM102.7 million a year earlier. Its performance was largely due to unrealised forex gains of RM2.2 billion recorded during the quarter.Axiata had a dramatic turnaround with a net profit of RM951 million in 3Q2024, from a net loss of RM797.41 million in 3Q2023, on account of its unrealised forex gain of RM1.03 billion.Meanwhile, Tenaga registered a forex gain of RM1.1 billion for 3Q2024, which lifted its net profit to RM1.6 billion, an 85% y-o-y increase and a 10% gain quarter on quarter (q-o-q).According to CSG-CIMB Research, if the forex gains were stripped out, along with other smaller one-off items, the utility company would have reported a q-o-q decline of 57% in net profit for 3Q2024 on seasonally higher overhead-related expenses during the quarter, which was further exacerbated by higher “other” operating costs.Besides forex gains and losses, another noticeable trend that emerged in the 3Q earnings was special dividends, which is likely a move to pay out dividends before the 2% dividend tax takes effect in 2025.Companies that paid out a substantial amount in special dividends this quarter include Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd (KL:MSC), Lysaght Galvanised Steel Bhd (KL:LYSAGHT) and MBM Resources Bhd (KL:MBMR).Lysaght stands as the company that declared the highest amount of special dividend in 3QFY2024, with a whopping 35 sen per share for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2024 (FY2024), which will be paid out on Dec 9. Together with an interim dividend of eight sen per share, its shareholders will have received a total dividend of 43 sen per share to date for FY2024.MBM Resources dished out a special dividend of 22 sen per share to its shareholders for 3QFY2024 — the second time for FY2024. It has paid out so far two interim dividends amounting to 13 sen and a special dividend of 10 sen in 2QFY2024. This brings its total dividends to 45 sen for FY2024, with one more quarter to go.Meanwhile, MSC will pay out its first special dividend since its listing. It announced a special dividend of 17 sen per share for FY2024 that will be paid out on Dec 23. It also announced an interim dividend of seven sen per share, bringing the total dividend declared to 24 sen for FY2024.It was interesting to note that Chin Teck Plantations Bhd (KL:CHINTEK) brought forward its dividend payment. The plantation company declared a special dividend of seven sen per share as well as a first interim dividend of eight sen per share for its financial year ending Aug 31, 2025 (FY2025). The dividends, which were announced prior to the conclusion of its first quarter ending Nov 30, will be paid on Dec 27.Overall, heads of research contacted by The Edge say their preliminary assessment shows that about half of the companies under their coverage saw 3Q earnings in line with expectations. However, there were more companies that came in below expectations compared to those who exceeded expectations.One head of research mentions that revenue in 3Q had generally improved on both y-o-y and q-o-q basis, pointing to better business undertones.There were a few disappointments among the FBM KLCI component stocks, which led to an underwhelming 3Q earnings season, according to CIMB Securities in its Nov 29 report.The net earnings of the benchmark index constituents in 3Q amounted to RM19.23 billion, a growth of 11.4% y-o-y and 2.9% q-o-q. Of the 30 component stocks, 17 saw improved earnings for the quarter compared with the previous year while 13 reported lower earnings.Leading the pack in weaker earnings for the quarter is Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (KL:PCHEM), which fell into a net loss for the first time since its listing more than 10 years ago.PetChem’s net loss for 3QFY2024 amounted to RM789 million, with its unrealised forex losses amounting to RM1.1 billion, without which it would have made an estimated net profit of RM352 million. The group’s earnings were affected by the sharp depreciation of the US dollar, mainly due to its investment in Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd (PPC).Maybank Investment Bank Research said in its report that the group’s cumulative nine months’ earnings for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (9MFY2024) at RM750 million came in below expectations at 72% of its full-year estimate.The research house said PetChem had started to recognise its 50% portion of PPC’s operating costs in 3Q2024, comprising RM300 million in interest expense and RM400 million in depreciation annually. It opines that PPC will be loss-making for the next three years. It has a “sell” call on the stock and lowered its 12-month target price to RM3.82 from RM4.18 previously.Integrated plantations company Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KL:KLK) did not fare well this quarter (4QFY2024 ended Sept 30), reporting a net profit of RM6.77 million, a sharp decline of 94.18% from a year earlier. Its lower net profit was a result of lower downstream margins and increased losses at its associate companies.In contrast, IOI Corp Bhd (KL:IOICORP) posted a 133.8% increase in net profit for the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (1QFY2025) to RM710.7 million from a year earlier.The company’s earnings were lifted by forex gains from its US dollar-denominated borrowings on the back of a strengthening ringgit in 3Q and fair value adjustments to its biological assets and derivative financial instruments. Excluding the RM449.5 million gain from one-off non-operating items, of which RM365.9 million was a net forex gain, its underlying profit before tax for 1QFY2025 was up 4% to RM359.1 million from RM344.4 million.Meanwhile, Genting Malaysia Bhd (KL:GENM) saw its 3QFY2024 net profit jump threefold from a year earlier on net unrealised forex gains amounting to RM601.8 million on its US-dollar denominated borrowings.The group’s net profit amounted to RM569.16 million for 3QFY2024 — the highest quarterly profit in almost six years — compared with RM177.41 million in 3QFY2023. However, if the impact of forex gains were excluded, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) would have been down 6%.Sunway Bhd (KL:SUNWAY) saw its net earnings increase 108% y-o-y to RM376.08 million on the back of stronger operating performance across its core businesses. It is the only company on the FBM KLCI to see its earnings double or more that was not propped up by unrealised forex gains in 3Q.Instead, its earnings were lifted by the recognition of an accumulated development profit of about RM124 million from its executive condominium development Parc Central Residences in Singapore.More energy companies reported improved earnings on a y-o-y basis in 3Q. Companies in the offshore support vessel (OSV) segment, such as Keyfield International Bhd (KL:KEYFIELD), Perdana Petroleum Bhd (KL:PERDANA) and Icon Offshore Bhd (KL:ICON) saw 3QFY2024 net profit improve at least three times from a year earlier.Keyfield chalked up a net profit of RM81.11 million for 3QFY2024, up six times from a year earlier, while Perdana’s net profit improved 3.3 times to RM75.8 million and Icon saw its net profit increase three times to RM19.43 million.The improvement in net profit was driven by better daily charter rates. Perdana and Keyfield also attributed the improvement in earnings to better utilisation of vessels, whereas Icon said utilisation fell to 78% from 86% in 3QFY2023 due to unplanned maintenance.Owner and operator of jack-up rigs Velesto Energy Bhd’s (KL:VELESTO) earnings for 3QFY2024 improved more than three times to RM42.93 million compared with the previous corresponding quarter. The improvement was attributed to higher utilisation and average daily charter rates for jack-up rigs.Meanwhile, fabrication company Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Bhd (KL:MHB) swung back into the black with a net profit of RM15.27 million for 3QFY2024 from a net loss of RM105.21 million a year earlier. It attributed the better performance to both its heavy engineering and marine segments.Interestingly, as a sector, the Bursa Malaysia Energy Index has not gained much this year. It has trended downwards since hitting a year high of 1,012.24 points on June 13. At 811.66 points on Nov 29, it was 0.74% lower than at the start of the year.All banks listed on Bursa saw a y-o-y improvement in net profit in the third quarter, save for Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd (KL:BIMB), whose net profit fell 7.2% y-o-y to RM130.44 million.Notably, Affin Bank Bhd recorded the largest percentage increase in quarterly net profit, up 45% to RM145.82 million from a year earlier on higher interest income and income from its Islamic banking business. The banking group also saw higher write-back of credit impairment losses and higher net forex gains during the quarter.Meanwhile, RHB Bank Bhd (KL:RHBBANK) posted a 28% y-o-y growth in its net profit, amounting to RM833.19 million, in 3QFY2024. The increase was attributed to sharp currency gains that lifted its non-interest income by RM659.86 million.Net income for the quarter stood at RM996.78 million, an 8.8% y-o-y increase, whereas other operating income doubled to RM1.045 billion on account of net forex gains.Many would agree that the most underwhelming earnings results for the quarter came from the technology sector as semiconductor companies are still waiting for the cycle to turn.Oppstar Bhd (KL:OPPSTAR) reported a net loss of RM1.73 million for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (2QFY2025). This was despite a higher revenue of RM21.72 million, up 54.8% y-o-y. The company made a net profit of RM4 million in the previous corresponding quarter.Oppstar, which is in the business of integrated circuit design, says its loss was mainly due to an increase in administrative expenses and a decline in other income.Another semiconductor-related company that made a loss during the quarter was Mi Technovation Bhd (KL:MI). It reported a net loss of RM7.2 million for 3QFY2024, compared with a net profit of RM14.16 million in the previous year, primarily due to a substantial unrealised forex loss in the quarter.In the company’s financial statements, it mentioned that it foresees the ringgit further strengthening by the end of 4Q. As a result, its board is of the view that the group’s net profit for FY2024 will come under pressure from unrealised forex losses and higher research and development expenditure. It added that it would take measures to effectively mitigate the forex risk.The automated test equipment manufacturers as well as the packing and testing companies in the electrical and electronics supply chain did not fare well in 3Q, with many posting weaker earnings than a year earlier. These include ViTrox Corp Bhd (KL:VITROX), Pentamaster Corp Bhd (KL:PENTA), Greatech Technologies Bhd (KL:GREATEC) and Inari Amertron Bhd (KL:INARI).While many languished, there were some that saw improved earnings during the quarter. Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd (KL:MPI) saw its net profit increase 82.4% y-o-y to RM30.13 million in the first quarter ended Sept 30, 2024 (1QFY2025). The company says the better performance was a result of its higher revenue, which inched up 0.6% to RM516.57 million, and lower operating expenses incurred during the quarter.Meanwhile, Unisem (M) Bhd’s (KL:UNISEM) 3QFY2024 net profit increased to RM26.75 million, up 48.5% from a year earlier, on the back of better revenue and forex gains made during the quarter. The increase in revenue and net profit was mainly attributed to higher sales volume and forex gains, as opposed to forex losses in the previous corresponding period.\\n\\n2.

News link: https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/1442079\\nNews: Broadcom forecasts Q1 revenue above estimates on strong AI chip demandBroadcom forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates on Thursday and predicted booming demand for its custom artificial intelligence chips in the next few years.Shares of the Palo Alto, California-based company were up 14% in aftermaket trade after CEO Hock Tan told investors on a conference call he expects a revenue opportunity from AI in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.Tan indicated three \"hyperscale\" customers are likely to deploy millions of AI chip clusters at the time.Big tech has been vying to reduce its dependence of pricey, supply-constrained AI processors made by front-runner Nvidia , helping Broadcom which makes advanced custom artificial intelligence chips for so-called hyperscalers.Demand for Broadcom\\'s networking chips that help move around vast amounts of data used by applications such as OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT has also increased, as businesses double down on investments in GenAI infrastructure.\"Broadcom\\'s strong performance doesn\\'t come as a surprise. It\\'s one of several companies benefiting from AI invigorating the global semiconductor industry, with its AI revenue growing 220% this year,\" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.The company forecast revenue of about $14.6 billion for the first quarter, compared with analysts\\' average estimate of $14.57 billion according to data compiled by LSEG.Analysts, however, have raised doubts about the amount of potential future business from Apple, one of Broadcom\\'s most significant wireless customers, as the iPhone maker works to design more of its chips in-house.Apple\\'s plans will include switching to a homegrown chip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections starting next year, replacing some parts currently provided by Broadcom, Bloomberg News reported earlier on Thursday.Though the company faces intense competition from Nvidia\\'s ethernet-like Infiniband products, Broadcom still benefits from the expansion of AI data centers as it is one of the largest providers of advanced networking equipment.\"Broadcom will continue to be a relevant player in the custom AI ASIC market together with companies like Marvell as tier-1 hyperscalers will continue to introduce their in-house chips,\" Summit Insights senior analyst Kinngai Chan said.Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, or ASICs, are chips designed for specific tasks or applications.While hailed as a chipmaker, Broadcom has proliferated into a tech conglomerate owing to buyouts such as its $69 billion acquisition of cloud-computing firm VMware. The infrastructure software segment grew 196% from a year earlier to $5.82 billion in the fourth quarter.The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $14.05 billion, a jump of over 50% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected $14.09 billion.On an adjusted basis, Broadcom earned $1.42 per share compared with estimates of $1.38 per share.\\n\\n3.

The ratio is used for valuing companies and to find out whether they are overvalued or undervalued. \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          P/E\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            Share Price\\n            Earnings per Share\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\text{P/E}}={\\\\frac {\\\\text{Share Price}}{\\\\text{Earnings per Share}}}}\\n  \\n\\nAs an example, if share A is trading at $24 and the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period is $3, then share A has a P/E ratio of \\u2060$24/$3/year\\u2060 = 8 years. Put another way, the purchaser of the share is investing $8 years to recoup the share price. Companies with losses (negative earnings) or no profit have an undefined P/E ratio (usually shown as \"not applicable\" or \"N/A\"); sometimes, however, a negative P/E ratio may be shown. There is a general consensus among most investors that a P/E ratio of around 20 is \\'fairly valued\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio\\nSummary: The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, commonly known as CAPE, Shiller P/E, or P/E 10 ratio, is a stock valuation measure usually applied to the US S&P 500 equity market. It is defined as price divided by the average of ten years of earnings (moving average), adjusted for inflation. As such, it is principally used to assess likely future returns from equities over timescales of 10 to 20 years, with higher than average CAPE values implying lower than average long-term annual average returns. \\n\\n The ratio was invented by American economist Robert J. Shiller.\\nThe ratio is used to gauge whether a stock, or group of stocks, is undervalued or overvalued by comparing its current market price to its inflation-adjusted historical earnings record.\\nIt is a variant of the more popular price to earning ratio and is calculated by dividing the current price of a stock by its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years.\\nUsing average earnings over the last decade helps to smooth out the impact of business cycles and other events and gives a better picture of a company\\'s sustainable earning power.\\nIt is not intended as an indicator of impending market crashes, although high CAPE values have been associated with such events.\\n\\nPage: PEG ratio\\nSummary: The \\'PEG ratio\\' (price/earnings to growth ratio) is a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share (EPS), and the company\\'s expected growth.\\nIn general, the P/E ratio is higher for a company with a higher growth rate. Thus, using just the P/E ratio would make high-growth companies appear overvalued relative to others. It is assumed that by dividing the P/E ratio by the earnings growth rate, the resulting ratio is better for comparing companies with different growth rates.\\nThe PEG ratio is considered to be a convenient approximation. It was originally developed by Mario Farina who wrote about it in his 1969 Book, A Beginner\\'s Guide To Successful Investing In The Stock Market. It was later popularized by Peter Lynch, who wrote in his 1989 book One Up on Wall Street that \"The P/E ratio of any company that\\'s fairly priced will equal its growth rate\", i.e., a fairly valued company will have its PEG equal to 1.  The formula can be supported theoretically by reference to the Sum of perpetuities method.\\n\\n']]"

This indicates that the company's ability to generate returns on its equity has decreased.\\n2. **EPS (Earnings Per Share) Trend**: The EPS has also been declining, from 16.92 in 2019 to 13.58 in 2023. This suggests that the company's earnings per share have decreased over time.\\n3. **Profit Margin**: The profit margin has been relatively stable, ranging from 22.45% in 2020 to 26.70% in 2022. However, it declined to 22.19% in 2023.\\n4. **Cash Flow**: The cash flow has been increasing over the years, with a significant increase in 2023. This suggests that the company is generating more cash from its operations.\\n5. **Gearing**: The gearing ratio has been decreasing over the years, indicating that the company's debt levels have decreased.\\n6. **PE (Price-to-Earnings) Ratio**: The PE ratio has been declining over the years, from 51.25 in 2019 to 56.28 in 2023. This suggests that the company's stock price is not as expensive as it was in the past.\\n7. **PB (Price-to-Book) Ratio**: The PB ratio has also been declining, from 8.47 in 2019 to 7.53 in 2023.

However, the declining ROE and EPS trends indicate that the company may be facing challenges in generating returns on its equity and earnings per share.
